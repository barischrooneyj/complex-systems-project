    """Returns a random graph according to the Barabási–Albert preferential
    attachment model.

    A graph of ``n`` nodes is grown by attaching new nodes each with ``m``
    edges that are preferentially attached to existing nodes with high degree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of nodes
    m : int
        Number of edges to attach from a new node to existing nodes
    seed : int, optional
        Seed for random number generator (default=None).

    Returns
    -------
    G : Graph

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If ``m`` does not satisfy ``1 <= m < n``.
