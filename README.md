## The two main Python notebooks are included at the root level.

ConvergenceGossip.ipynb  // Looking at convergence in aggregation gossip model.

StochasticResonance.ipynb  // Looking at stochastic resonance in gossip.

## The notebooks can be viewed in rendered format on github:

## Or on Google colab where you can run it too:

## We also include a generated media files folder 'media' because some of the
simulations take quite long.

## Partly used or partly finished code is included in the folders.
